12/4/18, 23:57 - Anusha: Okayyy
12/5/18, 00:36 - Ishnoor Singh: Yeah... but ... it's frustrating and extremely infuriating...
12/5/18, 00:36 - Ishnoor Singh: I hope you can see how
12/5/18, 08:45 - Ishnoor Singh: Anyways...
12/5/18, 08:45 - Ishnoor Singh: Umm
12/5/18, 08:45 - Ishnoor Singh: See
12/5/18, 08:46 - Ishnoor Singh: Hey... if not at the moment... I always let her know if something she did made me feel bad... and she understands
12/5/18, 08:49 - Ishnoor Singh: Yeah... umm ... Anusha... you do have some flaws... but there is no one who doesn't...  Pulak has his own enormous character flaws... I do too... so does any human being I've met... and I think you're aware of everything and that's what counts... that and understanding... even in hindsight where one did something wrong is the most anyone can achieve...
12/5/18, 08:50 - Ishnoor Singh: That's what I think
12/5/18, 08:50 - Ishnoor Singh: Sooo...beating yourself up... even from time to time isn't the answer At all
12/5/18, 08:51 - Ishnoor Singh: And it's possible I'm reading everything completely wrong ... and may have over spoken
12/5/18, 21:13 - Anusha: Yes but never say I trained my girlfriend, she is a human being not an animal
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: No
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: It was a bad fight
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: It happens
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: Honestly
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: I won't tell u if anything like that happens from now
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: People dip and have self doubt
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: Neither of us are beating ourselves
12/5/18, 21:14 - Anusha: So yeah
12/5/18, 21:15 - Anusha: Honestly, it's okay to feel and sometimes you don't have to psychoanalyse
12/5/18, 21:29 - Ishnoor Singh: I hope you do know what I meant...
12/5/18, 21:30 - Ishnoor Singh: Anusha.... You know I'd much rather know... but I can't possible force you to... it's upto you

12/27/18, 09:11 - Anusha: Do u think I am kinda boring in a relationship
12/27/18, 09:11 - Ishnoor Singh: what do you mean boring?
12/27/18, 09:12 - Anusha: Like I am not anti physicalness
12/27/18, 09:12 - Anusha: I dunno
12/27/18, 09:12 - Ishnoor Singh: go on
12/27/18, 09:12 - Anusha: Isn't that the reason people cheat
12/27/18, 09:12 - Anusha: I dunno
12/27/18, 09:13 - Ishnoor Singh: umm sis... idts either of them are the kind of guys who would let a need  for physicality get  in between anything
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: I think I am a pretty chill gf
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: I don't stop him
12/27/18, 09:13 - Ishnoor Singh: also.... did sarthak cheat?
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: From anything
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: I even told hom
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: It was okay for him
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: To have sex with people there
12/27/18, 09:13 - Ishnoor Singh: anything meaning you and him doing stuff
12/27/18, 09:13 - Ishnoor Singh: woah...
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: For me it was
12/27/18, 09:13 - Anusha: If he would have told me
12/27/18, 09:14 - Ishnoor Singh: meaning
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: He and anoushka had a thing
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: I would have been hurt
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: And probably mad
12/27/18, 09:14 - Ishnoor Singh: you think they did?
12/27/18, 09:14 - Ishnoor Singh: just asking
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: But at least there would have been honesty
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: At that point
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: I did
12/27/18, 09:14 - Ishnoor Singh: ok... i understand
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: That too
12/27/18, 09:14 - Anusha: Ya I am okay with that
12/27/18, 09:14 - Ishnoor Singh: umm.. idk why pulak said that ...or in what context...
12/27/18, 09:15 - Ishnoor Singh: but i don't think he meant it one bit
12/27/18, 09:15 - Ishnoor Singh: you and i both understand saying stuff that we don't mean one bit, right?
12/27/18, 09:15 - Ishnoor Singh: he must have ben mad about something
12/27/18, 09:16 - Ishnoor Singh: second... whatever sarthak did was by no means about how physical or open you were or weren't in that relationship
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: No
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: But that
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: It was low blow
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: Okay
12/27/18, 09:16 - Ishnoor Singh: i can say that for sure
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: In his defense

12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: I told him I settled for him and I knew I was way out of his league
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: 🙈
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: That was heat if the moment
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: I guess
12/27/18, 09:16 - Anusha: But I mean
12/27/18, 09:16 - Ishnoor Singh: to pulak?

12/27/18, 09:17 - Ishnoor Singh: yeah...
12/27/18, 09:17 - Anusha: But I would think about that
12/27/18, 09:17 - Ishnoor Singh: and none of that i tru in our minds
12/27/18, 09:17 - Anusha: Why do people cheat
12/27/18, 09:17 - Anusha: I tried my best to be the cool gf
12/27/18, 09:17 - Ishnoor Singh: ummm…. Anusha the cheating you are talking about is a completely different thing
12/27/18, 09:17 - Ishnoor Singh: for suure...
12/27/18, 09:18 - Ishnoor Singh: and people do cheat cause they are boredor cuse they don't know how to be honest... but those aret the kind of people you chose
12/27/18, 09:18 - Ishnoor Singh: both of these guys arennt of that quality
12/27/18, 09:19 - Ishnoor Singh: about how physical you are in a relationship.... i don't know the details of it
12/27/18, 09:19 - Ishnoor Singh: but i think atleast in this one... you guys had clear discussions about this, right?
12/27/18, 09:20 - Ishnoor Singh: and as long as you both have the right convos, low levels of physicality wont lead to any cheating-ish problems
12/27/18, 09:20 - Anusha: Ya
12/27/18, 09:20 - Anusha: But still
12/27/18, 09:20 - Ishnoor Singh: i am sure pulak understands what he is doing with a long distance rrelationship
12/27/18, 09:20 - Anusha: Why not tell me
12/27/18, 09:20 - Ishnoor Singh: all of us do
12/27/18, 09:20 - Anusha: And I dunno
12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: I don't think physicality is a problem
12/27/18, 09:21 - Ishnoor Singh: hey... it didn't happen in that manner,right?

12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: Ya he does
12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: And he wont cheat
12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: But I was wondering
12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: Am I boring
12/27/18, 09:21 - Ishnoor Singh: hmm?
12/27/18, 09:21 - Anusha: Also do I not behave enough like a girl

I'm to blame for that too... when I started dating her, I never thought I compromised on us Anusha  and I swear I never would compromise on us, I won't lie sis, I love her, I really do! But hey! I love you tooo... it's a hugely different love... but I do love ya... we've had an year of being angry at each other... but the last few days have been like they used to be with us... I love being close to you sis... you're one the of few people I don't feel scared around... and I hate imagining not being able to come to you... but, what I hate soooooooooooooooooooooo much more is you not being happy and me not being able to do anything about it..m or worse not knowing about it... I promise, I'll check in a few times a week for sure... but please promise if you have a bad day, a bad week, a bad test, a bad bloody class as well and you think you can lemme know just lemme know anything will work... I promise to find a way to make you smile if not make your problems go away... ik most of the times me failing to make you smile might make you smile as well... Anusha... I call you my sis cause I really mean it... you  I hope there's always forgiveness for a sibling... ik I fucked up a few dozen times and that I'll fuck a few dozen more, but please try and lemme in, ik I am clumsy worker and I mess things up, I might be useful once in a while, and I hope I can help take care of you... ik you're an amazingly strong person I might just end up spectating... but idk ... I'd just wanna be a part of your life... ik it's probably not an adult thing to do... but I consider you my sibling... I hope next year were closer than ever and ik how kiddish, idiotic, weird and chape that sounds

2/5/19, 20:28 - Anusha: Listen Ishnoor, I am not in a very great headspace at this point in time vis-a-vis my previous friends and I really need some time apart from all of y'all. It's not that I am mad or hurt it's just that I need to self introspect as well as re-evaluate my relationships. Hence, for my selfish reasons I shall block you for a couple of days till I completely comprehend the state if affairs. 
I will completely get it if you are not interested in furthering this friendship and all because I genuinely believe Nayamat gives you great emotional strength and support and she truly is awesome. If that's the case just send me a text on some other platform saying the same. Thank you for ur consideration
