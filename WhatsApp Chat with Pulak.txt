10/7/18, 01:23 - Pulak: See weve barely spoken today
10/7/18, 01:24 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmmm okay
10/7/18, 01:24 - Pulak: So I can’t tell what’s going on with her, she’s obviously pretty upset
10/7/18, 01:24 - Pulak: Probably ready to break up with me
10/7/18, 01:24 - Ishnoor Singh: And you aren't? Upset?
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: And? What do you want?
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: I haven't talk to anusha
10/7/18, 01:25 - Pulak: Well yeah, I want to talk to her at least
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: Not much
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok? And then?
10/7/18, 01:25 - Pulak: I don’t want to duhhh
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: What do you expect off her? Rn?
10/7/18, 01:25 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... try this one... why are you dating her?
10/7/18, 01:26 - Pulak: How was it
10/7/18, 01:26 - Ishnoor Singh: I am just asking painful questions... idk if this is going anywhere
10/7/18, 01:26 - Ishnoor Singh: She was agitated
10/7/18, 01:26 - Ishnoor Singh: And awake upto 10 mins ago
10/7/18, 01:26 - Pulak: Resolve things hopefully
10/7/18, 01:27 - Pulak: Make her feel better
10/7/18, 01:27 - Ishnoor Singh: To what end?
10/7/18, 01:27 - Ishnoor Singh: If you don't mind?
10/7/18, 01:28 - Pulak: To talk at least, see today, I texted her, she texted back, both one word, I tried to talk normally and got one word answers
10/7/18, 01:28 - Pulak: Ik she’s upset
10/7/18, 01:28 - Ishnoor Singh: You feel this is unfair?
10/7/18, 01:28 - Pulak: The short answer is that she makes me feel happy
10/7/18, 01:29 - Ishnoor Singh: Or is there another word there?
10/7/18, 01:29 - Pulak: There’s a longer answer but I don’t want to type that much
10/7/18, 01:29 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... and what about today
10/7/18, 01:29 - Ishnoor Singh: Haan Haan it's fine
10/7/18, 01:29 - Pulak: I know
10/7/18, 01:29 - Pulak: That was the only time we talked today
10/7/18, 01:29 - Ishnoor Singh: Same
10/7/18, 01:30 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... Pulak... what do you feel... if you take Anusha out of this context
10/7/18, 01:30 - Ishnoor Singh: What do you feel rn?
10/7/18, 01:30 - Pulak: No not really, unfair isn’t the word
10/7/18, 01:30 - Ishnoor Singh: Why are you awake at 430?
10/7/18, 01:30 - Pulak: Idk
10/7/18, 01:30 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok? Think of something for my sake?
10/7/18, 01:31 - Ishnoor Singh: I am not gonna report this
10/7/18, 01:31 - Pulak: I mean those feelings don’t  change everyday
10/7/18, 01:31 - Ishnoor Singh: ?
10/7/18, 01:31 - Pulak: That’s a constant
10/7/18, 01:31 - Pulak: One bad day doesn’t change my feelings
10/7/18, 01:31 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmm and do you think she knows?
10/7/18, 01:31 - Pulak: As in?
10/7/18, 01:32 - Ishnoor Singh: And do you think she feels that way ?
10/7/18, 01:32 - Pulak: Well obviously I’m upset
10/7/18, 01:32 - Ishnoor Singh: Or how do you think she feels in general as opposed to today?
10/7/18, 01:32 - Pulak: I was walking around campus
10/7/18, 01:32 - Pulak: Came back at like 3:30
10/7/18, 01:32 - Pulak: Lying in bed now
10/7/18, 01:33 - Pulak: It was nice and peaceful
10/7/18, 01:33 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... why didn't you sleep
10/7/18, 01:33 - Ishnoor Singh: Not alone I hope!
10/7/18, 01:33 - Pulak: Huh?
10/7/18, 01:33 - Ishnoor Singh: I mean relax this is all between you and me
10/7/18, 01:33 - Pulak: I mean I tell her but I don’t think she understands the depth of what I mean behind them
10/7/18, 01:34 - Pulak: To her they’re just words at this point
10/7/18, 01:34 - Pulak: She says she does and I believe her
10/7/18, 01:34 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmmm... OK... doesn't understand as in doesn't feel or hasn't felt it or doesn't believe?
10/7/18, 01:34 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok fair enough
10/7/18, 01:34 - Pulak: Not today lol but in general
10/7/18, 01:35 - Pulak: It’s weekend and also fall break 🤷🏻‍♂
10/7/18, 01:35 - Ishnoor Singh: Cool
10/7/18, 01:35 - Pulak: No no, I could’ve but no,
10/7/18, 01:35 - Ishnoor Singh: Dont. Not beyond 12 pl
10/7/18, 01:35 - Pulak: This guy I was with ran around so much right after drinking hot chocolate
10/7/18, 01:36 - Ishnoor Singh: Remind you of someone?😅
10/7/18, 01:36 - Pulak: He puked, and the campus police was going by and asked if he was drinking
10/7/18, 01:36 - Ishnoor Singh: Ahahahhaaa
10/7/18, 01:36 - Pulak: Lolol
10/7/18, 01:36 - Ishnoor Singh: D good story
10/7/18, 01:36 - Pulak: No that’s nothing, right after I spoke to you last night
10/7/18, 01:37 - Pulak: I got a call from one of the indians, one of the Indian guys drank too much at a party and was puke level drunk
10/7/18, 01:38 - Ishnoor Singh: Hm
10/7/18, 01:38 - Pulak: So he was puking and groaning in her room and she had to call pretty much the entire Indian group to take care of him
10/7/18, 01:38 - Ishnoor Singh: Lol
10/7/18, 01:38 - Pulak: I think both
10/7/18, 01:38 - Ishnoor Singh: Ummm so you think she hasn't felt it?
10/7/18, 01:39 - Pulak: Maybe partly because I’m not showing it the right way, and also partly because she’s been in this zone where she doesn’t feel that anything people do for her means anything
10/7/18, 01:40 - Pulak: Campus is safe, not going anywhere off campus alone
10/7/18, 01:40 - Pulak: Yeah kinda
10/7/18, 01:40 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmm... we have been trying to chip away at part 2... but I failed bro... sooo... what can we do on part1
10/7/18, 01:40 - Ishnoor Singh: Or do you wanna work through part 2 again?
10/7/18, 01:40 - Pulak: For part 2, I’ve been trying for months
10/7/18, 01:40 - Ishnoor Singh: I will do as you say
10/7/18, 01:41 - Ishnoor Singh: You're the one with the best chance
10/7/18, 01:41 - Ishnoor Singh: And you know her the most
10/7/18, 01:41 - Ishnoor Singh: So... tell me
10/7/18, 01:41 - Ishnoor Singh: What should be done
10/7/18, 01:41 - Ishnoor Singh: And let's do this... even thought it is ethically flawed to ask that of you
10/7/18, 01:43 - Pulak: Honestly I can’t tell what she’s feeling right now, because from the things she says, she has way more friends than I have, yet she feels that she has no friends, so I have no clue how to deal with it
10/7/18, 01:43 - Pulak: Maybe she doesn’t feel close to them
10/7/18, 01:43 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmmmm
10/7/18, 01:43 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok so...
10/7/18, 01:43 - Pulak: Which I know will come with time, she knows it as well
10/7/18, 01:43 - Ishnoor Singh: That was my conclusion to
10/7/18, 01:44 - Ishnoor Singh: *too
10/7/18, 01:44 - Ishnoor Singh: She sais
10/7/18, 01:44 - Ishnoor Singh: *d
10/7/18, 01:44 - Ishnoor Singh: Something about no one to fall back on
10/7/18, 01:44 - Pulak: That I know she has said, but I doubt she has tried it yet
10/7/18, 01:45 - Pulak: Either the trust comes with time, or you take a leap of faith
10/7/18, 01:45 - Ishnoor Singh: Do you think our current Anusha will?
10/7/18, 01:45 - Ishnoor Singh: Try?
10/7/18, 01:45 - Pulak: See for me, You know I go with the time approach
10/7/18, 01:46 - Pulak: I don’t know about part 1
10/7/18, 01:46 - Pulak: You tell me
10/7/18, 01:46 - Ishnoor Singh: And for me ... number works just as well
10/7/18, 01:46 - Ishnoor Singh: About?
10/7/18, 01:46 - Pulak: No
10/7/18, 01:46 - Pulak: Not for a while at least
10/7/18, 01:46 - Ishnoor Singh: Pulak you and I are fundamentally different in part one
10/7/18, 01:46 - Ishnoor Singh: Not till she messes up too bad
10/7/18, 01:46 - Ishnoor Singh: I don't wanna be able to watch that
10/7/18, 01:47 - Pulak: For one thing, the environment there is not exactly the friendliest
10/7/18, 01:47 - Pulak: Atmosphere wise
10/7/18, 01:47 - Ishnoor Singh: I don't wanna say that
10/7/18, 01:47 - Pulak: We both know what I mean
10/7/18, 01:47 - Ishnoor Singh: Yes I do
10/7/18, 01:47 - Ishnoor Singh: But I don't wanna know ir
10/7/18, 01:47 - Ishnoor Singh: *t
10/7/18, 01:48 - Pulak: I don’t want to either, but I see her talking about people, and it seems like she gets along well with everybody
10/7/18, 01:48 - Pulak: And everybody loves her
10/7/18, 01:48 - Ishnoor Singh: Yeah...
10/7/18, 01:48 - Ishnoor Singh: That's where the prob is
10/7/18, 01:48 - Ishnoor Singh: It's an extension of what happened here na?
10/7/18, 01:48 - Ishnoor Singh: Same thing?
10/7/18, 01:49 - Pulak: I know but still
10/7/18, 01:49 - Pulak: Yes
10/7/18, 01:49 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... so here are my thoughts
10/7/18, 01:49 - Pulak: Well sorta
10/7/18, 01:51 - Ishnoor Singh: If she likes you... which I think she did toh for sure... a lot..m then you had as much part one as you do now... should I mess with that... also... part one... will that be me being involved too much with you two? And third... you and I are diff... idk what to tell you
10/7/18, 01:51 - Ishnoor Singh: Go on
10/7/18, 01:51 - Ishnoor Singh: But if you wann discuss it
10/7/18, 01:51 - Ishnoor Singh: A madman awaits you at the end of this text chain
10/7/18, 01:51 - Pulak: Bwahaha go ahead
10/7/18, 01:52 - Pulak: Never hurts to hear different perspectives
10/7/18, 01:52 - Pulak: She did for sure but now not so sure?
10/7/18, 01:52 - Ishnoor Singh: About what? Being sweet?
10/7/18, 01:52 - Ishnoor Singh: Arey I haven't talked to her in2-3 months
10/7/18, 01:53 - Ishnoor Singh: Do you think we talked about you too much?
10/7/18, 01:53 - Ishnoor Singh: Then toh she used to talk about you very very often
10/7/18, 01:53 - Pulak: Good point
10/7/18, 01:53 - Ishnoor Singh: Lol I hated it
10/7/18, 01:53 - Ishnoor Singh: Bro... I go over board with everything...
10/7/18, 01:53 - Pulak: About whatever you want to call it 😂
10/7/18, 01:54 - Ishnoor Singh: We're talking about making her feel special right?
10/7/18, 01:54 - Pulak: Lol I can imagine that would be weird for you
10/7/18, 01:54 - Ishnoor Singh: Cause if it's something else...
10/7/18, 01:54 - Pulak: That is what I intend to do now
10/7/18, 01:54 - Pulak: Yeah
10/7/18, 01:55 - Pulak: What else would it be
10/7/18, 01:55 - Ishnoor Singh: No mate... I was kidding... if she wants to talk about something I don't say no
10/7/18, 01:55 - Ishnoor Singh: Good.. Cause I thought u were going above and beyond ... I was like no... no advice there
10/7/18, 01:55 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok...
10/7/18, 01:55 - Ishnoor Singh: Only if it's you
10/7/18, 01:55 - Ishnoor Singh: Don't do me
10/7/18, 01:56 - Ishnoor Singh: That's not you
10/7/18, 01:56 - Ishnoor Singh: <Media omitted>
10/7/18, 01:56 - Ishnoor Singh: Like this... is me
10/7/18, 01:56 - Pulak: Ummm does trying to book flight tickets to Ithaca for next week count as going overboard

10/7/18, 02:00 - Ishnoor Singh: Hmmmm
10/7/18, 02:00 - Pulak: Can’t spend that rn
10/7/18, 02:00 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok...

10/7/18, 02:04 - Pulak: Just general stuff

2/5/19, 21:36 - Ishnoor Singh: <Media omitted>
2/5/19, 21:36 - Pulak: The way I see it is from the message she sent
2/5/19, 21:36 - Ishnoor Singh: She'll be too
2/5/19, 21:37 - Ishnoor Singh: Meaning?
2/5/19, 21:37 - Pulak: Sorry
2/5/19, 21:37 - Pulak: Yeah so based off what she sent
2/5/19, 21:37 - Ishnoor Singh: Don't be
2/5/19, 21:38 - Pulak: What I see is that she’s gonna think about us and take a call because of the way things currently are
2/5/19, 21:38 - Pulak: Based on expectations vs reality
2/5/19, 21:38 - Pulak: So it’s kind of like an ultimatum
2/5/19, 21:39 - Pulak: Go ahead
2/5/19, 21:39 - Pulak: I am sort of conflicted whether or not I should send a text
2/5/19, 21:40 - Pulak: I really want to but there’s not much to say there because she made it clear she wanted time to think about the future
2/5/19, 21:41 - Ishnoor Singh: Welll... you don't have to
2/5/19, 21:41 - Ishnoor Singh: Same for me

2/5/19, 22:00 - Ishnoor Singh: Mate... trust me... you're way better off
2/5/19, 22:00 - Ishnoor Singh: Just about to get free
2/5/19, 22:13 - Pulak: Nope
2/5/19, 22:13 - Pulak: Ummm I think I kinda saw this coming over the weekend
2/5/19, 22:13 - Pulak: Most of this is m y fault
2/5/19, 22:14 - Pulak: Haan no worries chill
2/5/19, 22:14 - Pulak: Hey, umm there’s not much I can say at this point given all of what you said but I understand what you mean and I’m sorry things are the way they are and they weren’t the way you wanted them to be. I don’t want you to feel you’re taking the responsibility for all of these aspects of our relationship but I guess you do that because you worry... you’re keeping up the promise we made to each other and I couldn’t be happier for that... if you need time to introspect go for it... I wish I could help but that’s not how things are... you know what my answer is going to be...
2/5/19, 22:15 - Pulak: Should I send this to her
2/5/19, 22:15 - Pulak: Either it goes in the next 10 mins or not at all
2/5/19, 22:18 - Pulak: I do feel like I should send a message before I sleep
2/5/19, 22:22 - Ishnoor Singh: How?????
2/5/19, 22:22 - Pulak: Its kinda a long story
2/5/19, 22:22 - Pulak: I can’t get into it today

2/5/19, 22:22 - Pulak: In essence
2/5/19, 22:23 - Ishnoor Singh: Hey, send something... and if that's what you wanna send then send that
2/5/19, 22:23 - Ishnoor Singh: Ok... got it mate
